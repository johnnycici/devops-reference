# Use ADR for Capturing Design Decisions

## Context and Problem Statement

As a busy architect wiring with multiple teams and diverse contextual areas, quickly capturing design decisions is cumbersome and fraught with issues. Primarily issues with multiple formats in capturing notes: email, chat, one off textual notes, etc. requires remembering how the orginal notes on the decision were taken and additional work to organize into something useful. By using a structured process like an Architectural Design Record, an architect can document and collaborate on the decision in a structured way.

## Considered Options

* One Note or shared OneDrive
* Rwsponses via email or chat to meeting invites
* Ticketing systems like Jira
* ADR in git repository

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "ADR in git repository", because By using the tructured ADR template, tools like ADR Manager are available as addons to visual studio code and generate a markdown textfile that can be reviewed and versioned easily
